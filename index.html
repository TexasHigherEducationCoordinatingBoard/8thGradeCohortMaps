      <h1>Insights from the 8th Grade Cohort Longitudinal Study</h1>
      <p><strong>By JOHN DINNING</strong> December 2017</p>

      <p>Just over one in five 8th graders from Texas public schools go on to graduate with a degree or certificate from a Texas institution of higher education. This is according to an annual study from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board that tracks 8th graders for an 11-year period. The latest study followed 8th graders from the 2005-2006 school year through high school and beyond.</p>
      <p>The cohort of 8th graders from 2006 is followed into higher education. But those students who attend colleges outside of Texas are not counted. For that reason, the overall enrollment and completion rates presented here understated. Nevertheless, the study reveals significant variation in rates of participation in higher education across the state.</p>
      <p>For example, in the El Paso region of far West Texas, 57% of students went on to enroll in higher education compared to only 49% in neighboring Midland. However, when looking at the rates at which students completed their higher education, the two regions were within one percentage point.</p>

    <p>The regions on the map correspond to the 20 Texas Education Agency’s service center regions. The regions vary greatly in population density and in the racial and ethnic makeup of the 8th grade cohort. The following map highlights the percentage of African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students in each region. Clicking on a region reveals additional information including the number of students in the original cohort.</p>

    <p>These groups, African Americans, Hispanics, and the economically disadvantaged are among the target populations of the Texas Higher Education Strategic Plan. The plan aims to increase the rate at which young Texans earn a higher education degree or certificate. And these students have lower rates of enrolling and completing a higher education credential than the overall population. In addition to African Americans, Hispanics, and the economically disadvantaged, the strategic plan also calls for efforts to increase the participation of male students in higher education. Males students enroll and complete college at lower rates than their female counterparts, this is especially true for African American males.</p>
    <p>The following maps highlights the difference in enrollment and completion rates between target groups and the 8th grade cohort overall. The percentage point difference (pp) provides a sense of how each target group lags, equals, or, in some cases surpasses the overall rates of enrollment or completion. For example, in the Austin region, about 54% of the 8th graders went on to enroll in higher education, but among African Americans, the rate was only about 52% resulting in a -2 pp difference. Compare this to the -9 percentage point difference in completion rates for African Americans in the Austin region where only 13% graduated, compared to 22% for the region’s 8th graders overall. </p>

    <section class="container-fluid section">
    <p>Given the investment in time and money that students put into higher education, not completing a credential can leave students burdened with debt and with little to show for it. Comparing enrollment rates with completion rates may provide a sense of how many students end up with the economic burden of paying for higher education, but without the benefits that come with a higher education credential.</p>
    <p>In the past, the State’s Higher Education Strategic Plan focused on getting more students into college. The new plan, known as 60x30, focuses on improving the rates at which students complete college and earn a post-secondary credential. </p>
