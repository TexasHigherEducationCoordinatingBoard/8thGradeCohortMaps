      <p>Just over one in five eighth graders from Texas public schools go on to graduate with a degree or certificate from a Texas institution of higher education. This is according to an annual study from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The maps below present regional results from the latest analysis which tracked eighth graders from the 2006-07 school year through higher education for 11 years. The
        <a href="http://www.txhighereddata.org/index.cfm?objectId=F2CBE4A0-C90B-11E5-8D610050560100A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full analysis</a>, including the methodology, is available on the
        <a href="http://www.txhighereddata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Higher Education Data</a> website.</p>
      <p>Higher education enrollment and completion rates for the eighth-grade cohort vary across regions in Texas. For example,
        in the El Paso region, 58% of students went on to enroll in higher education compared to only 48% in neighboring
        Midland. However, when looking at the rates at which students completed their studies and earned a higher education
        degree or certificate, the two regions were only three percentage points apart.</p>

      <p>The state’s strategic plan, <a style="font-style:italic" href="http://www.60x30tx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60x30TX</a>, includes an annual completion goal of 550,000 certificates or degrees in 2030. The plan also identifies target populations: African American, Hispanic, economically disadvantaged, and male students. These groups enroll in college and complete a higher education credential at lower rates than the overall population. The following map shows completion rates among the target populations.</p>

      <p>The 20 regions on the map correspond to the Education Service Center (ESC) regions defined by the Texas Education Agency. The regions vary greatly in population density and in the racial and ethnic makeup of the eighth-grade cohort.</p>
      <p>The following map presents information about the total student population and the percentage of African American, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students in each region. Hovering over a region reveals additional information including the number of students in the original cohort from each target group.</p>

      <p>The following two maps highlight the difference in enrollment and completion rates between target groups and the eighth-grade cohort overall. The percentage point (pp) difference provides a sense of how each target group lags, equals, or in some cases, surpasses the overall rates of enrollment or completion. For example, in the Austin region, about 53 percent of the eighth-graders went on to enroll in higher education, but among African Americans, the rate was about 52 percent, resulting in a difference in enrollment rates of -1 pp. Compare this to the -10 pp difference in completion rates for African Americans in the Austin region, where only 13 percent graduated, compared to 23 percent for the region’s eighth-graders overall.</p>

      <p>In the past, the Texas Higher Education Strategic Plan focused on getting more students into college. The new plan, <span style="font-style:italic" >60x30TX</span>, focuses on improving the rates at which students complete college and earn post-secondary credentials. The map below shows how completion rates for certain groups of students lag behind completion rates overall.</p>
      <p>Given the investment in time and money that students put into higher education, not completing a credential can leave students burdened with debt and with little to show for it. Showing the difference between enrollment rates and completion rates provides a sense of how many students end up with the economic burden of paying for higher education without the benefits that come with a higher education credential.</p>
